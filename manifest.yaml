# If a file datasource hasn't already been pulled into memory, its contents are
# serialized with other info about the datasource if they're smaller than this
# value. Otherwise, they're copied into a raw_data directory, and a pointer to
# the file is put into the datasource's record. Set to 0 to put everything into
# json regardless of file size. Set to a negative number to put everything into
# a raw data directory. Defaults to 0 if not specified. Below is 2**19.
