# We want to ensure that snd-seq is always loaded for those who want to use
# the sequencer interface, but we can't do this automatically through udev
# at the moment...so we have this rule (just for the moment).

# Remove the following line if you don't want the sequencer.

install snd-pcm /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install snd-pcm && /sbin/modprobe snd-seq
