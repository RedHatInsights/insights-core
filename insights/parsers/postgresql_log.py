    """
    Read the PostgreSQL log files.  Uses the ``LogFileOutput`` class parser
    functionality - see the base class for more details.

    The PostgreSQL log files contain no dates or times by default::

        LOG:  shutting down
        LOG:  database system is shut down
        LOG:  database system was shut down at 2015-03-31 05:05:12 UTC
        LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
        LOG:  autovacuum launcher started

    Because this parser reads multiple log files, the contents of the shared
    parser information are a list of parsed files.  This means at present
    that you will need to iterate through the log file objects in that list
    in order to find what you want.

    Examples:
        >>> for log in shared(PacemakerLog):
        ...     print "File:", logs.file_path
        ...     print "Startups:", len(logs.get('ready to accept connections'))
        ...
