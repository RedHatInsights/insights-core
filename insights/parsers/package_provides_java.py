PackageProvidesJava - command ``/bin/echo {java_command_package}``
==================================================================

.. warning::

    This module is deprecated, please use
    :mod:`insights.parsers.package_provides` instead.

This command reads the output of the pre-command:

``for jp in `/bin/ps auxwww | grep java | grep -v grep| awk '{print $11}' | sort -u`; do echo $jp `readlink -e $jp | xargs rpm -qf`; done``

This command looks for all versions of 'java' running and tries to find the
RPM packages which provide them.  The running command and its package name
are stored as properties ``command`` and ``package`` of the object.

The reason why using above pre_command is that we need to record the links
between running_java_command and package which provides the java command. In
``ps aux`` output, we can only get what java command starts a java
application, instead of java package. Through this way, when there is jdk
bug, we can detect whether a running java application will be affected.

Typical contents of the pre_command::

    /usr/lib/jvm/jre/bin/java java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.141-3.b16.el6_9.x86_64

Parsed result::

    self.command = "/usr/lib/jvm/jre/bin/java"
    self.package = "java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.141-3.b16.el6_9.x86_64"

Examples:

    >>> command_package = shared[PackageProvidesJava]
    >>> command_package.command
    '/usr/lib/jvm/jre/bin/java'
    >>> command_package.package
    'java-1.8.0-openjdk-headless-1.8.0.141-3.b16.el6_9.x86_64'

Raises:
    insights.parsers.ParseException: if there is no java application running

Raises:
    insights.parsers.SkipException: if running java command is not provided by package installed through yum or rpm
