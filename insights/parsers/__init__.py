    """Split lines of a list into key/value pairs

    Use this function to filter and split all lines of a list of strings into
    a dictionary. Named arguments may be used to control how the line is split,
    how lines are filtered and the type of output returned.  See parameters for
    more information.  When splitting key/value, the first occurence of the
    split character is used, other occurrences of the split char in the line
    will be ignored. ::func:`get_active_lines` is called to strip comments and
    blank lines from the data.

    Parameters:
        lines (list of str): List of the strings to be split.
        comment_char (str): Char that when present in the line indicates all
            following chars are part of a comment.  If this is present, all
            comments and all blank lines are removed from list before further
            processing.  The default comment char is the `#` character.
        filter_string (str): If the filter string is present, then only lines
            containing the filter will be processed, other lines will be ignored.
        split_on (str): Character to use when splitting a line.  Only the first
            occurence of the char is used when splitting, so only one split is
            performed at the first occurrence of `split_on`.  The default string is `=`.
        use_partition (bool): If this parameter is `True` then the python `partition`
            function will be used to split the line. If `False` then the pyton `split`
            function will be used. The difference is that when `False`, if the split
            character is not present in the line then the line is ignored and when
            `True` the line will be parsed regardless. Set `use_partition` to `True`
            if you have valid lines that do not contain the `split_on` character.
            Set `use_partition` to `False` if you want to ignore lines that do not
            contain the `split_on` character. The default value is `False`.
        ordered (bool): If this parameter is `True` then the resulting dictionary
            will be in the same order as in the original file, a python
            `OrderedDict` type is used. If this parameter is `False` then the resulting
            dictionary is in no particular order, a base python `dict` type is used.
            The default is `False`.

    Returns:
        dict: Return value is a dictionary of the key/value pairs.  If parameter
        `keyword` is `True` then an OrderedDict is returned, otherwise a dict
        is returned.

    Keys in the row data have ' ' and '-' replaced with '_', so they can
    match the keyword argument parsing.  For example, the keyword argument
    'fix_up_path' will match a key named 'fix-up path'.

    In addition, several suffixes can be added to the key name to do partial
    matching of values:

    * '__contains' will test whether the data value contains the given
      value.
    * '__startswith' tests if the data value starts with the given value
    * '__lower_value' compares the lower-case version of the data and given
      values.

    Arguments:
        rows (list): A list of dictionaries representing the data to be
            searched.
        **kwargs (dict): keyword-value pairs corresponding to the fields that
            need to be found and their required values in the data rows.

    Returns:
        (list): The list of rows that match the search keywords.  If no
        keyword arguments are given, no rows are returned.

    Examples:
        >>> rows = [
        ...     {'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'nofile', 'value': 1024},
        ...     {'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'hard', 'item': 'nofile', 'value': 65536},
        ...     {'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'stack', 'value': 10240},
        ...     {'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'hard', 'item': 'stack', 'value': 3276},
        ...     {'domain': 'root', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'nproc', 'value': -1}]
        ...
        >>> keyword_search(rows, domain='root')
        [{'domain': 'root', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'nproc', 'value': -1}]
        >>> keyword_search(rows, item__contains='c')
        [{'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'stack', 'value': 10240},
         {'domain': 'oracle', 'type': 'hard', 'item': 'stack', 'value': 3276},
         {'domain': 'root', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'nproc', 'value': -1}]
        >>> keyword_search(rows, domain__startswith='r')
        [{'domain': 'root', 'type': 'soft', 'item': 'nproc', 'value': -1}]
