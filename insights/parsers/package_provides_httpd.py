PackageProvidesHttpd - command ``/bin/echo {httpd_command_package}``
====================================================================

.. warning::

    This module is deprecated, please use
    :mod:`insights.parsers.package_provides` instead.

This module parses the content that contains running instances of 'httpd' and
its corresponding RPM package which provide them. The running command and its
package name are stored as properties ``command`` and ``package`` of the object.

The reason why using above datasource is that we need to record the links
between running_httpd_command and package which provides the httpd command. In
``ps aux`` output, we can only get what httpd command starts a httpd
application, instead of httpd package. Through this way, when there is httpd
bug, we can detect whether a running httpd application will be affected.

Examples:
    >>> package.command
    '/opt/rh/httpd24/root/usr/sbin/httpd'
    >>> package.package
    'httpd24-httpd-2.4.34-7.el7.x86_64'
