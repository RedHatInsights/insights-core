    Parse the ``/etc/resolv.conf`` file into a dictionary of keywords and
    their values.  This is made available via the ``data`` property but the
    object itself can be used as a dictionary thanks to the
    :py:class:`insights.core.LegacyItemAccess` mixin class.

    Each keyword found in the file is stored as a key in the data dictionary,
    storing the list of values given (in order) on all occurrences of that
    keyword in the file.

    According to the man page, the 'domain' and 'search' keywords are
    mutually exclusive. If more than one instance of these keywords is
    present, whichever is last becomes the active resolution method. So, the
    ``active`` key stores which of these keywords was the last present in the
    file.

    Sample file content::

        ; generated by /sbin/dhclient-script
        # This file is being maintained by Puppet.
        # DO NOT EDIT
        search a.b.com b.c.com
        options timeout:2 attempts:2
        nameserver 10.160.224.51
        nameserver 10.61.193.11

    Examples:
        >>> resolv = shared[ResolvConf]
        >>> resolv['active']
        'search'
        >>> resolv['nameserver']
        ["10.160.224.51", "10.61.193.11" ]
        >>> resolv['search']
        ["a.b.com", "b.c.com"]
        >>> resolv.data["options"]  # old style access
        ["timeout:2", "attempts:2"]
