        Find all the (available) logs that are after the given time stamp.

        If `s` is not supplied, then all lines are used.  Otherwise, only the
        lines contain the `s` are used.  `s` can be either a single string or a
        strings list. For list, all keywords in the list must be found in the
        line.

        .. note::
            The time stamp is time type instead of usual datetime type. If
            a time stamp is not found on the line between square brackets, then
            it is treated as a continuation of the previous line and is only
            included if the previous line's timestamp is greater than the
            timestamp given.  Because continuation lines are only included if a
            previous line has matched, this means that searching in logs that do
            not have a time stamp produces no lines.

        Parameters:
            timestamp(time): log lines after this time are returned.
            s(str or list): one or more strings to search for.
                If not supplied, all available lines are searched.

        Yields:
            Log lines with time stamps after the given time.

        Raises:
            TypeError: The ``timestamp`` should be in `time` type, otherwise a
                `TypeError` will be raised.
