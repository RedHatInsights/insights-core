"""
The filters module allows developers to apply filters to datasources. A filter
is a simple string, and it matches if it is contained anywhere within a line.

If a datasource has filters defined, it will return only lines matching at
least one of them. If a datasource has no filters, it will return all lines.

Filters aren't applicable to "raw" datasources, which are created with
``kind=RawFileProvider`` and have ``RegistryPoint`` instances with ``raw=True``.

The addition of a single filter can cause a datasource to change from returning
all lines to returning just those that match. Therefore, any filtered
datasource should have at least one filter in the commit introducing it so
downstream components don't inadvertently change its behavior.

The benefit of this fragility is the ability to drastically reduce in-memory
footprint and archive sizes. An additional benefit is the ability to evaluate
only lines known to be free of sensitive information.

Filters added to a ``RegistryPoint`` will be applied to all datasources that
implement it. Filters added to a datasource implementation apply only to that
implementation.

For example, a filter added to ``Specs.ps_auxww`` will apply to
``DefaultSpecs.ps_auxww``, ``InsightsArchiveSpecs.ps_auxww``,
``SosSpecs.ps_auxww``, etc. But a filter added to `DefaultSpecs.ps_auxww` will
only apply to ``DefaultSpecs.ps_auxww``. See the modules in ``insights.specs``
for those classes.

Filtering can be disabled globally by setting the environment variable
``INSIGHTS_FILTERS_ENABLED=False``. This means that no datasources will be
filtered even if filters are defined for them.
