IPv6 - Check whether IPv6 is disabled
=====================================

This combiner reports whether the user has disabled IPv6 via one of the
many means available to do so. At present, only whether IPv6 is disabled on
the running system is reported; it provides no information regarding whether it
would continue to be after a reboot.

Per https://access.redhat.com/solutions/8709 , IPv6 may be disabled by

RHEL 7:
 * ``ipv6.disable=1`` Kernel command line argument
 * ``disable_ipv6`` option in ``sysctl``

RHEL 6:
 * ``option ipv6 disable=1`` in `modprobe.d`
 * ``install ipv6 /bin/true`` (fake install) in `modprobe.d`
 * ``disable_ipv6`` option in ``sysctl``

While they aren't tested explicitly, there are some means by which you can
attempt to disable IPv6 that are ineffective, such as setting
``blacklist ipv6`` in `modprobe.d`; those methods will yield no result from
this combiner.

The only requirement of this combiner is ``Uname``, but accurate detection
relies on information from combiners marked optional. If, for example, it's run
against a RHEL6 system without information from ``ModProbe``, it will miss any
of those disabling options and possibly return a false negative. For that
reason, this combiner shouldn't be relied on to state definitively that IPv6 is
enabled or disabled.
