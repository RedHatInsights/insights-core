"""
Red Hat Release
===============

Combiner for Red Hat Release information. It uses the results of
the ``Uname`` parser and the ``rht_release`` parser to determine the release
major and minor version.  ``Uname`` is the preferred source of data. The Red
Hat Release is in obtained from the system in the form major.minor.  For
example for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 system, the release would be
major = 7 and minor = 2.  The returned values are in integer format.Re

Examples:
    >>> rh_release = shared[redhat_release]
    >>> rh_release.major
    7
    >>> rh_release.minor
    2
    >>> rh_release
    Release(major=7, minor=2)
