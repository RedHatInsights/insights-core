# Scan the filesystem?
scan_filesystem: true

# Scan the running processes?
# Disabled by default due to its potential performance impact on the host when scanning numerous or large processes
scan_processes: false

# Perform a simple test scan of the insights-client config directory and process to verify installation and scanning
# are working correctly.  The results from this scan do not show up in the webUI.
# Once verified, disable this option to perform actual malware scans.
test_scan: true

# scan_only: a single or list of files/directories/process IDs to scan, for example:
# scan_only:
# - /var/www
# - /home
# ... means scan only files in /var/www and /home.  May also be written as scan_only: [/var/www, /home]
# scan_only: 12345
#... means scan only process ID 12345
# No value means scan all files/directories/PIDs
scan_only:

# scan_exclude: a single or list of files/directories to be excluded from filesystem scanning
# If an item appears in both scan_only and scan_exclude, scan_exclude takes precedence and the item will be excluded
# The scan_exclude list is pre-populated with a number of top level directories that are recommended to be excluded
scan_exclude:
- /proc
- /sys
- /cgroup
- /selinux
- /net
- /mnt
- /media
- /dev

# scan_since: scan files created or modified since X days ago or since the 'last' scan.
# Valid values are integers >= 1 or the string 'last'.  For example:
# scan_since: 1
# ... means scan files created/modified since 1 day ago
# scan_since: last
# ... means scan files created/modified since the last successful scan
# No value means scan all files regardless of created/modified date
scan_since:

# Exclude mounted network/external filesystems mountpoints?
# Scanning files within mounted network filesystems may be slow and cause extra network traffic.
# They are excluded by default, meaning that files in network/externally mounted filesystems are not scanned.
# Their mountpoints will be added to the scan_exclude list of directories to be excluded from scanning
exclude_network_filesystem_mountpoints: true

# List of network/external filesystem types to search for mountpoints on the system.
# If any mountpoints are found for these filesystem types, the value of the exclude_network_filesystem_mountpoints
# option will determine if files within the mountpoints are scanned or not.
network_filesystem_types: [nfs, nfs4, cifs, smbfs, fuse.sshfs, ceph, glusterfs, gfs, gfs2]

# Add extra metadata about each scan match (if possible), eg file type & md5sum, matching line numbers, process name
# The extra metadata will display in the webUI along with the scan matches
add_metadata: true

# Specific location of the yara binary file.  Autodetected if not specified.  For example:
# yara_binary: /usr/local/bin/yara
yara_binary:

# Abort a particular scan if it takes longer than scan_timeout seconds.  Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour)
scan_timeout: # 3600

# Run the yara process with this nice priority value.  Default is 19 (lowest priority)
nice_value: # 19

# The max number of CPUs threads used by yara when scanning.  Autodetected, but default is 2
cpu_thread_limit: # 2
