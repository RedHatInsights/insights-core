"""
UserNamespaces - Check whether user namespaces are enabled
==========================================================

This shared reducer reports whether user namespaces are enabled for the running
system per the kernel command line, and if grub info is available, for which
boot configurations they're enabled.

The user namespaces feature was introduced in kernel version 3.8, first shipped
in RHEL 7.x. It is built into the kernel, but requires an option to enable:

``user_namespaces.enable=1``

There are a few checks which are presently left to callers:
    * ``enabled()`` doesn't check whether the kernel supports user namespaces, only that the command line argument to enable them is present.

    * There is currently no attempt to relate the current kernel to a grub entry, which may be useful to know, if e.g. grub configuration has been changed, but the system needs a reboot.
