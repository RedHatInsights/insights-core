Tutorial - Custom Parser and Rule
=================================

In this tutorial we'll walk through authoring a new
Insights Parser and a Rule to use that Parser.

There are three primary phases to developing a rule:

1. Develop and test the parser
2. Develop and the rule
3. Test the rule and parser

We'll cover each step in detail in the sections ahead, so let's get started!  All
of the example code is available in the ``insights-core/docs/examples`` directory
of the insights-core project.
