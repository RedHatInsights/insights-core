In this tutorial we'll walk through authoring a new insights-core rule.  The
purpose of a rule is to evaluate various facts and determine one or more

1. Determine rule logic and identify parsers and combiners
2. Develop the rule
3. Develop the tests

We'll cover each step in detail in the sections ahead, so let's get started!
