Insights Shell
==============
The insights shell is an ipython-based interactive environment for exploring
insights components. You can run it against your local system or different
kinds of packaged data like insights archives, sosreports, JBoss Diagnostic
Reports, must-gather archives, and more. See ``insights shell -h`` for
details.
