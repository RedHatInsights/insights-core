    "A simple use-case for troubleshooting is the identification of installed software on the system.  In this example, we will examine checking a system for the usage of `bash` based on data from the `rpm` command.  This \"walkthrough\" will avoid going into details.  Instead, it will simply lay out how the use-case could be handled using `insights-core`.  More detailed tutorials can be found [in the docs](http://insights-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",

    "We'll assume we have `insights-core` already installed following the [instructions on the README.rst](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/README.rst).  Next we need to import the necessary modules."
