    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**It's important to remember that a condition shouldn't return `None` when it means `False`**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "That's because `None` signals \"Could not determine whether True or False\" to other systems. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@condition(SomeConfig)\n",
    "def check_bar_greater_than_10(config):\n",
    "    if \"bar\" in config:\n",
    "        return int(config[\"bar\"]) > 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the appropriate boolean value for `check_bar_greater_than_10` if \"bar\" doesn't exist in `config`? It could be treated as `False`, but the value isn't actually there, and if we don't know the default value, the condition can't really say either way.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you could do one of two things depending on whether you want the rule to still execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could raise a `dr.SkipComponent()` instead of returning `None`. External systems will still treat the condition's value as `None`. If the condition is required by the rule, the rule won't execute. If the condition is optional for the rule, the rule will still execute but will be passed `None` for the condition's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the condition returns `None`, external systems will treat its value as `None`, and the dependent rule will execute whether the dependency is required or optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following rule will always execute if the condition's dependencies are met and it doesn't raise an exception regardless of what the condition returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@rule(check_bar_greater_than_10)\n",

    "    if \"bar\" in config:\n",

They're all defined as `RegistryPoint` instances, which are special datasources with which datasource implementations for particular contexts can register themselves. For more information about how registration and overrides work, see the [Datasource Registry Tutorial](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-core/blob/master/notebooks/Datasource%20Registry.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RegistryPoint` can take two optional keyword arguments, `multi_output` and `raw`. If a datasource implementation should produce multiple outputs (glob files, foreach_collect, foreach_execute), the RegistryPoint for it should have `multi_output=True`. If the `.content` attribute should be a single string instead of a list of lines, set `raw=True`. This allows parsers dealing with json, xml, etc. to parse content directly without joining all the lines back together first. You also should pass `kind=RawFileProvider` to the datasource implementation so that it conforms to the contract defined by its `RegistryPoint`.\n",
