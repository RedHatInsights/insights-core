Maybe you want to execute a command in one context, but you want to read from a file in another. Parsers depend on a single datasource, but jamming multiple collection methods into a single implementation isn't attractive.\n",

Then you can provide implementations for the registry points in the form of datasources that are members of subclasses of your original class. This keeps the alternative implementations cleanly separated while allowing parsers to depend on a single component."
