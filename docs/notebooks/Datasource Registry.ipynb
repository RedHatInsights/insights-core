    "What if you have datasources on which many downstream components depend, and you want to provide different ways of collecting the data they represent? Maybe you want to execute a command in one context but read from a file in another. Parsers depend on a single datasource, and jamming multiple collection methods into a single implementation isn't attractive.\n",

    "Instead, you can define a subclass of `insights.core.spec_factory.SpecSet` that has `insights.core.spec_factory.RegistryPoint` instances instead of regular datasources. Then you can provide implementations for the registry points in the form of datasources that are members of subclasses of your original class. This keeps the alternative implementations cleanly separated while allowing parsers to depend on a single component.\n",
