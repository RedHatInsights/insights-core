    "As an example of standardizing interfaces, `chkconfig` and `service` commands can be used to retrieve similar data about service status, but the command you run to check that status depends on your operating system version. A datasource would be defined for each command along with a parser to interpret its output. However, a downstream component may just care about a service's status, not about how a particular program exposes it. A combiner can depend on both `chkconfig` and `service` parsers (like this, so only one of them is required: `@combiner([[chkconfig, service]])`) and provide a unified interface to the data.\n",

    "As an example of a higher level view of several related components, imagine a combiner that depends on various ethtool and other network information gathering parsers.
