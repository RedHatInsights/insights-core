    "# Filtering of Data in Insights Parsers and Rules\n",
    "In this tutorial we will investigate filters in insights-core, what they are, how they affect your components and how you can use them in your code.  Documentation on filters can be found in the [insights-core documentation](https://insights-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_index.html#module-insights.core.filters).\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purposes of filters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to prevent the collection of sensitive information while enabling the collection of necessary information for analysis, and;\n",
    "2. to reduce the amount of information collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filters are typically added to rules since the purpose of a rule is to analyze particular information and identify a problem, potential problem or fact about the system.  Filters may also be added to a parser if it is required to enable parsing of the data.  We will discuss this further when we look at the example.  Filters added by rules and parsers are applied when the data is collected from a system.  Filters are combined so that if filters are added from multiple rules and parsers, each rule will receive all information that was collected.  An example will help demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you write some rules that needs information from `/var/log/messages`.  This file could be very large and contain  potentially sensitive information so it is not desirable to collect the entire file.  Lets say *rule_a* needs messages that indicate `my_special_process` has failed to start.  And another rule, *rule_b* needs messages that indicate that `my_other_process` had the errors `MY_OTHER_PROCESS: process locked` or `MY_OTHER_PROCESS: memory exceeded`.  Then the two rules could add the following filters to ensure that just the information they need is collected:\n",
    "\n",
    "*rule_a*:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_filter(Specs.messages, 'my_special_process')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*rule_b*:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "add_filter(Specs.messages, ['MY_OTHER_PROCESS: process locked',\n",
    "                            'MY_OTHER_PROCESS: memory exceeded'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this would be that when `/var/log/messages` is collected, the filters would be applied and only the lines containing the strings `'my_special_process'`, `'MY_OTHER_PROCESS: process locked'`, or `'MY_OTHER_PROCESS: memory exceeded'` would be collected.  This significantly reduces the size of the data and the chance that sensitive information in `/var/log/messages` might be collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is significant benefits to filtering, you must be aware that a datasource is being filtered or your rules could fail to identify a condition that may be present on a system.  For instance suppose a rule *rule_c* also needs information from `/var/log/messages` about `process_xyz`.  If *rule_c* runs with other rules like *rule_a* or *rule_b* then it would never see lines containing `\"process_xyz\"` appearing in `/var/log/messages` unless it adds a new filter.  When any rule or parser adds a filter to a datasource, that data will be filtered for all components, not just the component adding the filter.  Because of this it is important to understand when a datasource is being filtered so that your rule will function properly, and include its own filters if needed."

Usernames, passwords, hostnames, security keys, and other sensitive information should not be collected.  In this case the `username` and `password` are in the configuration file so to prevent them from being collected we should add a filter to this parser.\n",

INI files are structured with sections which are identified as a section name in square brackets like `[section name]`, followed by items like `name` or `name=value`.  One possible way to filter an INI file is to add the filter `\"[\"` which will collect all lines with sections but no items.  This can be successfully parsed by the INI parser, so that is how we'll filter out this sensitive information in our configuration file.  We'll rewrite the parser adding the `add_filter(Specs.death_star_config, '[')` to filter all lines except those with a `'['` string."
